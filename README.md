# Proj_08A_K_Means

This project is based on K-means clustering, which is used to categorize a dataset into different groups. In this code, data is generated and then clustered using the K-means algorithm.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to partition the data into various clusters and determine the appropriate number of clusters. We use the "elbow method" and "silhouette score" to identify the optimal number of clusters.

Features
Data Generation: A dataset of 2500 samples is created with 4 centers.
K-means Clustering: The K-means algorithm is used to cluster the data.
Visualization: Scatter plots for both the original data and the clusters.
Elbow Method: A plot of SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) to determine the correct number of clusters.
Silhouette Score: Analysis of the silhouette score for different numbers of clusters.
Usage Instructions
Install Required Libraries:

pip install matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the Code:
Execute the provided code in a Python environment. It will perform K-means clustering and display the results.

Analyze the Results:
